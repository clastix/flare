## Executive Summary

As artificial intelligence and high-performance computing demands surge, organizations face critical GPU resource challenges: escalating costs, limited availability, and vendor lock-in across cloud providers. FLARE (Federated Liquid Resources Exchange) addresses these challenges by pioneering intent-based GPU provisioning through federated resource management.

This review documents FLARE's development journey, highlighting the successful demonstration of multi-provider GPU federation and the introduction of industry-first declarative resource allocation that transforms manual provider browsing into automated, intelligent placement decisions.

## Project Timeline and Deliverables

### Mid-Term Deliverables (Architecture Phase)

- **Architecture Design**: System architecture with FLUIDOS integration
- **API Specification**: RESTful API for GPU resource management
- **GPU Annotation System**: Metadata framework for GPU discovery
- **Technical Integration Plan**: FLUIDOS enhancement requirements
- **GPU Resource Management**: Discovery, filtering, and allocation workflows
- **Documentation**: API references, deployment guides, and quickstart documentation

### Final Deliverables (Implementation Phase)

- **FLARE API Gateway**: Complete development of FLARE API Gateway for intent-based GPU management
- **Test Environment**: KinD-based multi-provider setup with GPU simulation

**Note**: CLI and GUI components were initially planned but prioritized focus on core API functionality and validation due to project execution constraints.

## Results Achieved Against KPIs and Milestones

### KPI Assessment Against Initial Targets

The FLARE project was evaluated against three key performance indicators established at project initiation:

| **KPI** | **Target** | **Status** | **Assessment** |
|---------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **KPI**: GPU Provider Federation | Scalable Architecture | **Fully Achieved** | Successfully demonstrated and validated multi-provider federation |
| **KPI**: GPU Utilization | 95% | **Architecture Complete, Validation Pending** | Requires real-world production workloads for numerical validation |
| **KPI**: Cost Reduction | 20-30% | **Architecture Complete, Validation Pending** | Requires real-world production deployments for numerical validation |

### KPI Results and Validation Status

**GPU Provider Federation - Fully Achieved**

The GPU Provider Federation objective was fully achieved, representing the core technical breakthrough detailed in the [Technical Innovations and Architecture](#technical-innovations-and-architecture) section. FLARE successfully demonstrated intent-based GPU provisioning across multiple simulated cloud providers, reducing multi-provider coordination from manual long processes to automated instant through a single API endpoint. The implementation established seamless GPU resource federation using FLUIDOS resource discovery with REAR protocol for provider communication and Liqo for multi-cluster networking, creating a framework that validates the technical feasibility of cross-provider GPU resource management.

**GPU Utilization and Cost Reduction - Architecture Complete, Validation Pending**

Both GPU Utilization (95% target) and Cost Reduction (20-30% target) objectives reached architectural completion but require sustained production workloads with real billing data for numerical validation. As detailed in the [Project Challenges](#project-challenges-and-technical-solutions) section, the development effort required for GPU-specific FLUIDOS enhancements led to strategic focus on architectural design and simulation-based testing rather than extensive real-world deployments.

The delivered framework includes all necessary components for future validation, including dynamic resource sharing architecture, intelligent placement algorithms, and a comprehensive simulation environment. However, actual performance metrics will depend on real-world usage patterns and cloud provider pricing dynamics.

## Technical Innovations and Architecture

FLARE addresses the fundamental challenge in modern GPU provisioning: the manual, time-consuming process of comparing specifications, pricing, and availability across multiple cloud providers. The current industry practice requires deep technical knowledge of each provider's offerings and often results in suboptimal resource allocation due to the complexity of cross-provider comparison.

FLARE's main breakthrough is intent-based GPU provisioning. Instead of manually browsing through different cloud providers comparing specs and prices, users just describe what they need ("I need 2x H100 GPUs for training, keep costs low, somewhere in Europe") and FLARE handles the rest. The system automatically finds, evaluates, and provisions the right resources across multiple providers, cutting what used to take hours down to seconds.

We built this on top of FLUIDOS rather than starting from scratch. FLUIDOS already had the multi-cluster networking (via Liqo) and resource negotiation (REAR protocol) pieces working, so we could focus on the GPU-specific parts. We extended FLUIDOS with a comprehensive GPU annotation system using the `gpu.fluidos.eu/*` namespace, which lets the system understand and match GPU requirements without breaking FLUIDOS core functionality.

The intent-based API works as a translator, taking simple user requests and converting them into the technical specifications that FLUIDOS needs. We tested this across multiple simulated cloud providers and confirmed that both the API design and the provider abstraction layer actually work as intended.

## Project Challenges and Technical Solutions

### Project Scope and Validation Challenges

We encountered some real constraints that shaped the evolution of the project. FLUIDOS works great for general resource federation, but it needed specific enhancements to handle GPU provisioning the way FLARE required. We successfully built these enhancements: GPU Flavor creation from node annotations and GPU-specific filtering in Solvers but it took more development effort than originally planned.

This GPU enhancement work, plus the reality of limited availability for real GPU hardware testing, forced us to make some strategic choices about validation. Instead of trying to run extensive real-world deployments with actual production workloads and real billing data, we focused on getting the architecture right and building comprehensive simulation-based testing. This let us prove that multi-provider GPU federation actually works, but it means the numerical validation of utilization and cost savings will have to wait for proper production deployments.


## Project Conclusion and Assessment

FLARE accomplished what we set out to do: build a working federated GPU provisioning system using FLUIDOS. The biggest win is **intent-based GPU provisioning**, something that didn't exist before. Instead of the current painful process of manually comparing GPU options across different cloud providers, users can now just describe what they need and let the system figure out the details.

This breakthrough, combined with proven multi-provider GPU federation, shows that there's a better way to handle cloud GPU provisioning. We've moved from "here's exactly how to configure your resources" to "here's what I want to accomplish", and that's a meaningful shift. The system we built includes a complete GPU federation framework on FLUIDOS, standardized ways to describe GPU resources across vendors, native Kubernetes integration, and thorough documentation covering APIs, GPU annotations, and mappings for both NVIDIA and AMD hardware.

The end result is a solid foundation for GPU federation that works. There's real potential here for broader innovation in how we manage GPU resources across multiple cloud environments.
